# Learn HTTP Servers in Go

## Overview

This repository contains my work and progress from the "Learn HTTP Servers in Go" course offered by [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-servers-golang). The course focuses on building a production-ready HTTP web server from scratch using the Go programming language.

**Note:** This repository is a result of following the course and contains code that is not entirely my own work. It serves as a demonstration of my learning journey and the skills I've acquired.

## Goal of the course

1. Understand what web servers are and how they power real-world web applications
2. Build a production-style HTTP server in Go, without the use of a framework
3. Use JSON, headers, and status codes to communicate with clients via a RESTful API
4. Learn what makes Go a great language for building fast web servers
5. Use type safe SQL to store and retrieve data from a Postgres database
6. Implement a secure authentication/authorization system with well-tested cryptography libraries
7. Build and understand webhooks and API keys
8. Document the REST API with markdown
